# Comma-Separated List Formatter

This is a simple Python script that interactively collects items from the user and prints them in a properly formatted, human-readable list.

## ✨ Features
- Collects items one by one until you press **Enter** with no input.
- Formats the list into a natural English style:
  - `["apples", "bananas", "cherries"]` → **"apples, bananas and cherries"**
- Logs execution details to `commaLog.txt`.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher (no external dependencies).

## 🚀 Usage
Run the script in a terminal:

```bash
python comma_list.py
